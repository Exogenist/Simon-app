# Simon-App
Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope, The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the series. If the user succeeds the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over. - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

This is my version of game uitilizing the svg framework to create seemless interactive grapghics that work on the mobile level as well as a desktop app as it was intended for.
